## Text Preprocessing

Very first step of NLP.  It includes:
* Getting rid of whole lines that are not conveying any usefull information
* Removing Punctuation, Numbers, extra spaces and any other unuseful characters
* Transforming everything into lower case, to decrease the number of potential features for later application in a model
* Removing sttop words
* Removing short words (< 3 characters)
* Stemming /  Lemmatization
